## Setup

TerbiumOS is frameworkless! Simply add as a static asset to your web server or application. Below is a small example implementation guide:

### Static

For this Demonstration I will be using Cloudflare Pages.

1. First go to [pages.dev](https://pages.dev) or to your [cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and login or create a free account! Once you are in the dashboard page in the side bar select pages. If you can't find pages refer to the image below.

2. Once your at the Cloudflare Pages Dashboard Select Create Project then Select Import from Github.

3. Now once your here you must Fork this Repository then Authenticate your Github Account with Cloudflare. Once you complete that you should see a page like this: ![image](https://github.com/z1g-project/Terbium/assets/72810050/42ddd88a-1c8d-4091-a0b2-2e0a27e97235)
4. Once you Select the repository you will see build options and your going to want to change the build command to this specificly and the output to this also specificly **exactly what is shown in the image below**

5. After that it should build and deploy successfully! 

### Backend Example

Want a HTTP Server or your hosting this on a VPS Heres how to get it on your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/TerbiumOS/webOS.git
cd webOS
npm install
npm start
```

**⚠️NOTE This is a example for starting the http server on localhost:6969 and if you wish to actually deploy this you will need to setup nginx or something similar to it**
