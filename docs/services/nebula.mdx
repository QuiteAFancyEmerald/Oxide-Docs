### Initial Configuration

Credits to @ProgrammerIn-wonderland for writing this wonderful tutorial.

- Create an account at https://www.cloudflare.com/
- Create an account at https://www.freenom.com/ (or any registrars)
- Find a free domain name at Freenom
- Click checkout
- Select (12 Months @ FREE)
- Select "Use DNS"
- Select Use your own DNS
- Go to cloudflare, click add new site, and enter the free domain name
- Select "Free Plan"
- Click continue, ignore DNS
- Copy the name servers cloudflare gives you
- Go back to your Freenom tab, enter in the name servers which cloudflare gave you
- You can keep IP blank
- Click continue
- Click complete order
- Go back to cloudflare tab, click "Check Nameservers"
- Select DNS on your right bar
- Enter in the IP of the server which will be hosting Nebula
- Target will be `@`
- Click Enable proxy (little gray cloud icon, if active its orange)
- Select SSL/TLS in your right bar
- Click "Flexible"

## Server Configuration

- SSH into the server you'll be using, I'll assume its running Ubuntu 22.04 (though the commands are the same for debian 10+ versions, and Ubuntu versions 20.04+)
- Run

```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash - \ &&
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs npm
git clone https://github.com/NebulaServices/Nebula.git
cd Nebula
npm i
npm ci
sudo nohup PORT=80 node . &
```

Make sure your firewall is configured to let through port 80 traffic!
Note: Server will need to run `cd Nebula && sudo nohup PORT=80 node . &` on reboot
