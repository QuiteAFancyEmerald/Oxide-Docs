# Better DNS Bypass (DNS)

- Know the credentials of your School's WIFI or utilize a hotspot
- Go to `chrome:policy` and Ctrl+F for `deviceopennetworkconfig`; click show more
- Edit the attached ONC, changing the GUID to the guid in the policy and the security to the security in the json; same with the name, SSID, and finally change the passphrase to the password
- Import the ONC in `chrome:network#general`
- Go to Wi-Fi settings as normal and the DNS shouldn't be blocked
