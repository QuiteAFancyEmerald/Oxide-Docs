# ChromeOS Terminal Open Redirect

This is an exploit that lets you open nearly any page from the ChromeOS terminal, even when SSH is disabled :)
## How do I use this?
1. Open the Terminal app on your ChromeOS laptop (doesn't matter if you can use SSH or not, it'll work anyway as long as you can open the Terminal app)
2. Create a new SSH connection with this configuration:
3. Set Command: ```chronos@127.0.0.1``` (this part doesn't matter, just needs to follow the format for a SSH user@host)
4. Set SSH relay server options as: ```--proxy-host=blocked_site_you_want_to_access.tld/path# --proxy-port=443 --use-ssl=true```
5. Right-click on the Terminal app icon and select your new SSH connection.

Enjoy getting to access your site without blocking.
## Notes
- This only works for the first page load on a blocked site, subsequent page reloads will probably still be blocked (e.g. if google.com is blocked and you do --proxy-host=google.com/#, it'll probably work, but once you search for something, that page will get blocked)
- This might not work for all extensions
### Extensions this is known to work for
- Securly
(I haven't tested any others, let me know if you find more)
### Extensions known to not work
- Cisco Umbrella (that one can be bypassed another way though)
- Lightspeed (one person got it to work, but other people haven't had it work)
### Extensions this partially works with
GoGuardian (apparently blocks after about 5 minutes in most cases, ⁠kajigs⁠ChromeOS Terminal Open Redirect)
### How do I access Discord?
Set the SSH relay server options to --proxy-host=discord.com/app# --proxy-port=443 --use-ssl=true.
