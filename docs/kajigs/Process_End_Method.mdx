# Process End Method

- Open Task Manager
- Press 'search'+'esc'
- Scroll all the way to the bottom and find your blocker extension and highlight it (click on it)
- Click 'End Process' it or press 'enter'
- Immediately go to your page and see that it's unblocked
- This will not last unless you use this bookmarklet javascript:onbeforeunload=i=>1

## If Task Manager is blocked:

- Go to `chrome-extension://` + your Extension ID + `/_generated_background_page.html`
- You can find the Extension ID by going to the puzzle piece, clicking on the 3 dots next to your filter and click manage extension and the is will be in the url
- The link for GoGuardian is `chrome-extension://haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh/_generated_background_page.html`
- Change the URL to `chrome://kill` (I recommend making it a bookmark (if your school blocked bookmarklets this one will still work))
