# Booting Linux on Lenovo laptops that have their BIOSes locked w/ a password
(This also works with Bitlocker enabled systems)

## Requirements
- Have a lenovo laptop (ex: P15s, 300e 2nd Gen)
- Have a usb with space to fill with Linux
- Have a personal computer to flash the usb
- Have "Use a device" in Windows Recovery enabled
- Have a locked OR unlocked BIOS

there are lenovo computers that can have their USBs disabled, here are their models:
- ThinkStation P520
- ThinkStation P520c
- ThinkStation P520 (30DC)

## Steps
1. Download a Linux distro livecd that you want, see ⁠pseudoboot - disabling Secure B… for distros that don't run under secure boot
2. Flash the iso to a usb drive using https://rufus.ie/ or balenaEtcher
3. This is where the crossroads start

### if you have your entire bios locked with a password:
1. boot into Windows Recovery holding shift when clicking the button to restart
2. go to Use a device
3. boot from your usb (where it says HDD at the end)

### if you have your bios unlocked, no password:
1 boot into the BIOS
2 hit the function key where it says "choose temp boot device" or similar
3 go to your usb with tab and hit enter

### after all this, you can choose to either:
install Linux fully to your usb if you have the storage
use the usb as a live install

or, wipe the internal ssd and install Linux to it

or, bruteforce your bitlocker'd ssd with some tools

## important
Make sure to have your school's wifi password on hand and ready. if you have a network that's wpa2 enterprise, contact me
For devices like the 300e 2nd gen, the trackpad won't work. this can be solved by using an external mouse via usb
The p15s will work fully w/ trackpad

On the 300e 2nd gen, wifi may not work. putting a config into iwlwifi fixes this

## After install (extremely important)
While on a hotspot, make sure to install macchanger after updating based on your package manager, debian has it
Macchanger will randomize your mac address so you won't get caught when connecting to wifi networks
