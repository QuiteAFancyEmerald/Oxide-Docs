# IStealYourDNS (DNS)

IStealYourDNS is a TitaniumNetwork-partnered service. With it, you can seamlessly block many web filters (GoGuardian, Lightspeed, ...) and never think about bypassing filters ever again.

## Installation

To install it, simply open your Wi-Fi's DNS settings, and set the name servers to "Custom" - replace any options available with `72.5.33.65`. If you have multiple boxes, set the last one to `1.1.1.1`.

Then, simply restart and you're done!
