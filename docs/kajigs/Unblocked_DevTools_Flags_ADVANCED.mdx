# Unblocked DevTools/Flags (ADVANCED)

This is a guide on how to use chrome launch options and a thread for discussing exploits related to the bash shell. I have been requested to make this several times

First of all, you will need some knowledge of bash, and you must know how to use vi.

This builds off of Permanently Remove Extensions (past v106).

Follow the instructions there, and stop once you have the bash shell.

- Run `cd ~/Downloads`
- Run `vi exploit.sh` to create a new shell file.
- In this shell file, put the line `pkill -9 chrome`
- After that, head over to `chrome:version`, and next to "command line options:" copy the entire really long thing
- Paste it into vi as a new line.

Now you can add whatever launch options you want! these are like the flags in chrome:flags, but there are way more available.

The full list is here: https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/

Some notable ones are: `--force-devtools-available` (devtools), `--bwsi` (guest mode), `--kiosk`(useless but funny), `--oauth-client-id`(breaks policy updating and profile syncing), `--disable-extensions-except`, `--show-login-dev-overlay`/`--show-oobe-dev-overlay`, `--enable-hangout-services-extension-for-testing`(adds a bunch of useless extensions), and more.

To execute chrome with the launch options set, exit vi (impossible), and run `sh <(cat exploit.sh) & disown`
