# killcurly (Securly, v107 and above):

RIP Cookie Dough to leaking. Regardless here is another exploit related to bypassing Securly.

- Visit `chrome://settings/signOut` (the O must be capital) and click the blue button. If this is "blocked_by_administrator", DM `SprinkzMC#8421` for an alternate URL.
- Visit `chrome://restart`. Alternatively, you can go to the Securly details in `chrome://extensions` and click "Allow access to file URLs" or just use `chrome://kill` on one of its extension pages. Securly will now reload and be broken.
- Go to `https://tinyurl.com/addsession` and add your school account back (personal accounts may even work for some people).
  **This has to be repeated each time you sign out of your computer. Feel free to test this for other extensions too.**
