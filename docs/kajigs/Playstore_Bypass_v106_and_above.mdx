# Playstore Bypass (v106 and above)

Make sure you are upgrading or powerwashing/recovering. Chrome Device Manager's notification should appear otherwise this will not work.

**MAKE SURE TO HAVE A HOME ACCOUNT ADDED!**

- Literally just log out/shutdown/restart when the Chrome Device Manager notif appears. LOCKING DOES NOT WORK.
- Open PlayStore and keep it open. Try to download some apps. Fiddle around with it. Don't switch accounts as that might lock you out.

Add accounts in `settings -> your school account name -> add account`. You don't need to go to Android settings and shouldn't!

**EASIER GUIDE**
After Powerwash, Recovering, removing account and adding it back in:

- The moment `Chrome Device Manager` pops up ( ðŸ’¼ ) do `chrome://restart`
- After that open Google Play and switch to your home account
