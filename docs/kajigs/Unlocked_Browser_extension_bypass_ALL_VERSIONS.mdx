# Unlocked Browser (extension bypass) ALL VERSIONS
How to abuse Eduphoria Lockdown Browser
(it’s not as locked down as you think)

## Requirements
No brain needed on this one cause its so simple
The Eduphoria Lockdown Browser kiosk app

## Steps:
1. Restart and launch Lockdown Browser from kiosk apps
2. Click the “eduphoria!” logo (why tf is it a hyperlink this is so stupid 😭)
3. Scroll down and click the YouTube logo
4. Click “Sign In” in the top right, then press the small “Privacy” text
5. Press the 9 dots (aka hamburger) at the top and press “Search”

You’re done. That was it. Why the educational lockdown browser has a hyperlink on the front page is beyond me.

## Limitations:
1. No tabs
2. No windows
3. No extensions
4. You can’t type URLs manually

This will probably never get patched. Have fun
