# Xray/XTLS: bypass firewalls

Xray is a program used to get around internet censorship, mostly used by people in China to bypass the Great Firewall, but we can use it to bypass restrictions on school wifi.

Prerequisites:
your school actually blocks stuff through a firewall (otherwise this would be useless)
a server outside of the firewall (generic linux server should do)
although I will try to make it as easy to follow and understand, some familiarity with using linux and the command line would be handy

This will only work if your school has a network firewall

How to determine if your school uses a network firewall:
Go find a blocked site (usually github, chatgpt, twitter, instagram, discord) and make sure none of your extensions are blocking them
Then, connect to hotspot and see if it has been unblocked 

This method will make your chromebook run the Xray-core program, which requires access to the terminal.
If you are enrolled, you can use something like e-halcyon/TerraOS chromeos to do this
E-halcyon setup guide is at https://fog.gay/
If you can't use your chromebook as the xray client, you can use an android device to run it (for xray, use AnXray on f-droid, for sing-box, use NekoBox on f-droid) but I don't have instructions for that yet 

## Chromebook Setup
This section shows you how to:
download Xray-core
set up config files using symlinks
use initctl to auto start Xray-core on boot
set up the proxy in chromeos wifi settings

### Download Xray-core from GitHub
Go here to find the latest release https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/latest
Download Xray-linux-64.zip from the Assets section and save it to your downloads
Unzip it in the Files app by right clicking and selecting "Extract all"

In my case, I will just run everything as root instead of chronos
To get root in crosh type shell and then sudo -i or go to VT2 by pressing ctrl+alt+forward arrow (the one at the top of your keyboard, not the right arrow) and log in as root

Note: If you are planning to install chromebrew (package manager for chromeos), you should probably do that first, otherwise you won't be able to unless you move stuff out of /usr/local
```bash
# create directory /usr/local/gabe and /usr/local/gabe/xray (you can rename gabe to something else
mkdir -p /usr/local/gabe/xray
# Rename and move the folder to the directory
mv /home/chronos/user/Downloads/Xray-linux-64 /usr/local/gabe/xray

Setting up config files with symlinks

For convenience you can use symlinks to quickly alternate between configs
If you change configs, make sure both the client and server are consistent. That is why using symlinks is convenient, because you can swap them with a single command

cd /usr/local/gabe/xray
# edit a config file with a text editor
vi config_number_one.json
# now, make a symlink to config.json
ln -sf config_number_one.json ./config.json
```
