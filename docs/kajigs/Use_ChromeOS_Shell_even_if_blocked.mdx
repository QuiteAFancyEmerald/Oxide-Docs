# Use ChromeOS Shell even if blocked

Before you attempt this, go to chrome-untrusted:crosh.
-If it says something along the lines of Crosh is blocked, you can't do this
-If it says Application Disabled By Administrator, this should work for you.
This has been tested up to version 108

## Requirements:
- Some kiosk apps, don't believe it matters which ones, although you may have to do several.
- Some patience.
- Ability to turn off wifi
- An account on the device (This means you can't do this during OOBE)
- Fast typing

## Steps
1. First off, open chrome, and sign out of the device.
2. When you get to the login screen, turn off your wifi.
3. Open one of your kiosk apps.
4. It should take a couple seconds to load, and then realize it has wifi off.
5. You should get to  a screen with something like Connect to wifi to continue. There will be a button that says Add Another Network, click it, and then spam Escape until at login.
6. You should be at the login screen, but this time, there will be no Apps or Add New User buttons in the corner. If there are, maybe try steps 3-5 again?
7. Log in to your account AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
8. You should most likely get a prompt that says Administrator has disabled multiple sign-in. If you don't, check chrome:policy about multiple sign-in and if it allows it, continue(?). If not, you probably screwed something up.
9. Press Escape(Esc) to close this prompt.
10. You should have a chrome window open, but there will be no taskbar and you can't open other windows. Don't close the window
11. Go to the URL bar, and type in Chrome-untrusted:crosh. If all was successful, you should be greeted with the familiar face of crosh. If not, feel free to ask for help down below.
12. Congratulations, you now have access to crosh. Feel free to experiment with this limbo signed-in state, as there may be more bypasses within it.
