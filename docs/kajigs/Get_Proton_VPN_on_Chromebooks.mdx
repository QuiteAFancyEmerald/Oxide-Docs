You can just copy and paste it and you'll get the right formatting.

Make sure that you start the paste right after the end quotation mark.

- Save the onc file
- Upload it to `chrome://network#general` all the way at the bottom where it says Import ONC File (don't worry if you don't notice anything, just try scrolling down a little more and it should say `Networks imported: 1` (regardless of how many you actualy imported)
