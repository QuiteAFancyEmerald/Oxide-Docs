# SKIOVOX exploit for ChromeOS

Exploit originally found by @AkaButNice
Exploit expanded by @Bypassi
Guide written by @Bypassi

## Summary
Skiovox is an exploit that allows for browsing within a completely unblocked Chrome
browser. It works on ChromeOS 118 and a wide range of previous versions.
- Skiovox utilizes a bug in kiosk apps
- Very similar to a bug from 3 years ago
Within the unblocked browser, you can
- Install extensions
- Bypass pretty much all blocks

## Kiosk apps
- A district-controlled app available from the login screen
- Most districts use them for standardized tests
These are required for this exploit. You cannot install these; only your school can!
See the following slide for a picture of what your Chromebook should look like
when you shut it down and turn it back on.
The Kiosk apps should be at the bottom right, to the right of the shutdown button, if its not there you can not use this exploit

## Stage 1
Before you start, you must be properly connected to a WiFi network.

First, sign out or restart your Chromebook to get
to the login screen.
Then, turn off your Wi-Fi using the control panel
in the bottom right.
Don’t forget or disconnect from any networks,
just turn it off completely.
This may not work while at school.

### Step 1.2
If you have a password input like the one in the
image, type in your password but do not press
enter.
If you don’t have one, you can skip this step.

### Step 1.3
Click on one of the apps in the “apps” section.
- Most of them work with this exploit
- Use the same app every time to save data
Instantly after you click on the app, run [alt+shift+s].
(NOT ctrl+alt+s)
If you did it fast enough,
a toolbar should appear.
If it didn’t, restart the steps.
Wait until you get a "Network not available"

### Step 1.5
The toolbar should still be open. Click accessibility, then click the question mark.
The toolbar will now close.
If you couldn’t do this step, try
again with another app.

Next…
If you see a “back” button on the network
error page:
- Go to stage 2A
Otherwise:
- Go to stage 2B or 2C
They have different steps!

## Stage 2A
For users with a back button
Note
You should have already typed in your password (step 1.2) by the time you’re here.
Remember that the steps in stage 2A are only for users who see a back button on
the network error page

### Step 2A.1
Click “add other WiFi network”.
Don’t type anything in.
Instead, immediately:
- Press the escape key twice, which should bring you to the login screen with
your password still typed in
- Press enter to log in
These steps must be done within ~4 seconds after
pressing the “add network” button.

### Step 2A.2
You may see a screen saying “multiple sign-in is disabled.” If you get this, simply
press the escape key on your keyboard to bypass it.

### Step 2A.3
There may be an open window belonging to your school profile. This window will
have your filter extensions installed.
Close this window if you like. There should be another one behind it.

### Step 2A.4
You should be able to see a
window with no managed
extensions installed.
This window is slightly
bugged. To fix this, click the
three dots in the upper right
corner of Chrome and select
“new window”.
Use this window instead.
Next…
If this is your first time setting up the exploit, do Stage 3. Otherwise, you’re done.

## Stage 2B
For users without a back button

### Step 2B.1
Press the “diagnose” button.
The diagnostics window will now
open, although you shouldn’t be able
to see it.

### Step 2B.2
Click “add other WiFi network” to
turn your WiFi back on. Don’t type
anything in, just wait until the
diagnostics page shows up.
This is known to be
inconsistent; try a few
times with a few apps
or try 2C.

### Step 2B.3
Click WiFi, then click the settings
link. Settings should now open.

### Step 2B.4
Close the settings window. There’s nothing
useful that you can do from device settings,
as device policies still apply.
Once you’ve closed it, you should be
focused on a Chrome window. This window
shouldn’t have any of your district’s
extensions installed.

Next…
If this is your first time setting up the exploit, do Stage 3. Otherwise, you’re done.

## Stage 2C
Also for users without a back button

### Step 2C.1
Click “add other WiFi network” to
turn your WiFi back on. Don’t type
anything in, just wait until the
kiosk app loads.

### Step 2C.2
Press [ctrl+alt+z] to open text-to-speech. This may be blocked for you.
Note that a noise will likely be made when you run this shortcut.

### Step 2C.3
Hold the search key. Press the O key, then the T key.
A tutorial window for ChromeVox should appear

### Step 2C.3
Click “resources”. Three links will show up; you can click any of them.
Your browser should now open
Next…
Once your browser is open, you can turn off TTS by running [ctrl+alt+z] again.
If this is your first time setting up the exploit, do Stage 3. Otherwise, you’re done.

## Stage 3
Making the experience smoother

### Issues with this exploit
1. It’s unclear how to add a Google account and install extensions
2. Most keyboard shortcuts don’t work
3. It’s hard to move or resize the window(s)

### The solution
The Skiovox Helper extension restores all of this functionality:
https://github.com/bypassiwastaken/skiovox-helper
In this section, I’ll explain how to install it.
You only have to set this up once! (per app)

### Step 3.1
A zip file of the extension is available on the releases in our GitHub. Feel free to
host this file yourself.
Find a way to download this zip file in your unblocked browser.
If you got here from stage 2A, make sure the following settings in
chrome://settings/downloads is turned off:"Ask where to save each file before downloading"

### Step 3.2
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Ensure that the developer mode switch in the top right is turned on
3. Click “load unpacked”
4. A file prompt should now appear
If you don’t get a file upload dialog, make sure you didn’t skip step 2A.4.

### Step 3.3
1. Find the zip file from step 3.1 in your Downloads section
2. Right-click it and press “extract all”
3. Double-click the newly created folder
4. Press “open”
The extension should now install.

### Step 3.4
Upon the first install, the extension will open a page where you can configure your
browser shortcuts.
For each shortcut shown:
1. Press the edit icon
2. Type the command shown
in the caption
You can now use most Chrome
commands (ctrl+T, ctrl+W, etc)

### Step 3.5
The Skiovox Helper replaces the new tab page. Open a new tab to see its main
menu. Try playing around with the buttons in the top right.
The web store only works on
recent ChromeOS versions.
You can use it to install VPN
extensions that bypass your school’s
internet filtering.

## Other notes
The main difference between the stages is:
1. 2A can open multiple windows
2. 2B and 2C can not
If your screen keeps falling asleep after five seconds, try using another kiosk app.
Every app has its own extensions, history, settings, etc.
It’s possible that google.com might be blocked for some users; we’re looking into
this.

## Opening device settings
If you only want to edit network settings, try chrome://network#select.
Again, device settings are mostly useless because device policies still apply, but…
If using 2A:
1. Click the settings icon instead of the help icon on step 1.5
If using 2B or 2C:
2. Simply go to chrome://os-settings

## Exiting the exploit
To exit the exploit, either:
1. Hold down on your power button (and sign out)
2. Type “chrome:quit” into a new tab
