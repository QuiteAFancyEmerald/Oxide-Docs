# uBlock Origin JS Injection, Run bookmarklets even if they're blocked

if your school allows the ublock origin chrome extension, then running any bookmarklet is possible via an obscure feature of the extension

userscript injection has existed as a feature since 2017, but not many people know about it

## Steps

1. Install ublock origin (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
2. Go to the extension's settings
3. Under the settings tab, check the "i am an advanced user" box and click on the cog icon (image 1)
4. Inside the advanced settings, change userResourcesLocation from unset to https://pastebin.com/raw/PPZ1T7uh (image 2)
5. In the custom filters tab of the settings, add *##+js(execute_script.js) as a filter (image 3)
6. Now you can press ctr+alt+tilde (~) to run any js on the current page
7. If you want to run a bookmarklet, just paste in the javascript: url and press enter on the popup
