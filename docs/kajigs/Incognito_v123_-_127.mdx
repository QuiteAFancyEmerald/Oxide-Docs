# Incognito (v123 - 127)

Incognito exploit for chromeOS v123-v127 (NOT FOR SKIDS/IDIOTS) (PATCHED COMPLETELY FROM v128, USE CAUB TO STAY ON v123-v127)
Found by some guy on https://issues.chromium.org/issues/341245382, reposted by https://github.com/s0urce-c0de, expanded by ts2021 (https://github.com/S-PScripts)

## Notes:
- This is completely patched from chromeOS v128. (This is patched from v126 but you can use temporary unexpire flags - look at step 1)
- You need to be able to go to chrome://flags. (I know many people can't go to it but I know some people can go to it still)
- This is quite similar to the incognito exploit from v105 with the spacesaver dns.
## Steps
1. Go to ```chrome://flags/#captive-portal-popup-window```. If you're on v126-v127 use the temporary unexpire flags: ```chrome://flags/#temporary-unexpire-flags-m124``` (v126) and ```chrome://flags/#temporary-unexpire-flags-m125``` (v126 and v127). (Thanks to @Brandon Prather (https://github.com/brandon421-ops)
2. If it doesn’t exist, make sure to be on chromeOS v123-v127. If you're on v128+, you need to downgrade to v123-v127.
3. Enable it.
4. Restart.
5. If the flag didn’t reset, you can continue. Else you cannot.
6. Go to Settings.
7. Click Wifi in the Network section.
8. Click your wifi.
9. Click Network.
10. Set Name servers to Custom name servers.
11. Set the first box to detectportal.firefox.com OR captive.apple.com OR 150.136.163.0 (yes you can use the v105 dns)
12. A sign in pop up should appear from your wifi. Click Sign in.
13. Do CTRL+T and you're now in Incognito mode!
14. Set Name servers back to what it was before.
