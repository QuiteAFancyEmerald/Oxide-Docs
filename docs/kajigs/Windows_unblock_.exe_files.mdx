# Windows unblock .exe files
Using this method, you can unblock almost any exe files on your school computer as long as your school uses a blacklist, rather than a whitelist. The method also doesn't work for apps that the school knows about, and are blocked by group policy. 

1. Download the .exe file to your Downloads folder
2. Open Windows PowerShell
3. Type cd Downloads
4. Type the command Copy .\filename C:\Windows\Temp\filename replacing "filename" with the name of your file.
5. Type the command C:\Windows\Temp\filename replacing "filename" with the name of your file.
6. Unblocked .exe file :)
