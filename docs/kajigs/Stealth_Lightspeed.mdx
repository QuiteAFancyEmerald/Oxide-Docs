# Stealth (Lightspeed)

This trick is specifically for when your chromebook is "locked" by a teacher, and any site you go to will get closed instantly. It can also hide the tab from the teachers and get around the "[teacher's name] has blocked this site" screen.

The way it works is by letting you put an iframe inside of the new tab window, where most chrome extensions don't have permission. This means that if a page is "temporarily blocked" by a teacher or they lock your chromebook you can still access almost every page that works in an iframe. I don't know what it shows up as on the teacher screen, but they likely will just see the new tab and not the actual site.

- Set your default search engine to bing

- Open a new tab

Use this bookmarklet:

```
javascript:document.write(`<style> iframe{margin:0px; border:none; padding:0px; outline:none} body{margin:0px}</style><iframe src = "${prompt("enter url")}" width = ${window.innerWidth} height = ${window.innerHeight} />`)
```

Enter a url that you want to visit.

Notes:

- This only works if bookmarklets are enabled
- Works ONLY with Lightspeed
