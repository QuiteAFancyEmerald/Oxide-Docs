# Pseudoboot
this kajig allows you to boot types of linux that aren't signed, like nobara or antiX.

this will not interfere with bitlocker in any way, don't worry

## Requirements:
- A usb device
- Personal computer
- A way to make a bootable usb
## Steps
1. install MXLinux, this has a cmd line tool called mokutil which we're going to use for this kajig
2. 
3. flash MXLinux to your usb drive
4. boot usb drive via built-in uefi boot manager or windows recovery
5. when in the DE open up a terminal and run sudo mokutil --disable-validation
6. if you are prompted for a pass, the password is demo

when creating a password
7. make the password "12345678". this removes a lot of hassle

8. reboot, don't pull out the usb
9. if you're booted back to windows, redo the process but when you reboot spam the boot manager key and boot back into the usb
10. press a key to preform MOK management
11. press enter on "change secure boot state"
12. when entering the password, when it says "enter the nth character in your password" hit the corresponding number and press enter
13. turn off secure boot validation
14. reboot

you should be set! now you can use any linux distro you like without worrying about secure boot
