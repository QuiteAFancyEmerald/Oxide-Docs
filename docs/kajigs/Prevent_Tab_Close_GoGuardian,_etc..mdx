# Prevent Tab Close (GoGuardian, etc.)

This is a really old exploit that originates all the way back to 2017/2018. Essentially it prevents your tab from being closed in the most simple way. Use as needed.

```js
javascript: onbeforeunload = (i) => 1;
```

Paste the above in a bookmark and run it on whatever tab you want to prevent force closing!
