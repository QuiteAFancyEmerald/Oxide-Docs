# Crimson Extention Corruption, Based on Corkey Works on 126 and above

1. Esc+Refresh+Power and re-enroll (Enter recovery page), or you can just powerwash. (alternatively, you can push on the little arrow next to your name, and push "remove user")

2. Log into your Chromebook and immediately turn off WiFi 

3. Go to chrome://extensions, turn on WiFi, and wait for your school’s blocking extension to appear.

4. As soon as it appears, turn off WiFi and restart as fast as possible. (if this does not work for you, try waiting a second or two, I found this to work better)

5. Log back in, go back to extensions, and wait. If it says your blocking extension could be corrupted or doesn’t appear at all, then it worked (wait at least a minute with a close watch in case it comes back)

6. If it didn’t work, start over. You have to be fast.
