# Skiovox Breakout

This extension helps you get permanent code execution in mv2/mv3 extensions in your school profile. That means you can execute code in these extensions, even when logged in normally, without skiovox.
Initial PoC was made by me.
@akabutnice  improved it, tested it and fixed issues with it. 
While this looks barebones, we will add updates to fix and improvements upon this project.

If you have any payloads please share them!


## Usage instructions
1. Extract this extension and install it to chrome://extensions as an unpacked extension. If there is an error loading manifest.json, check for any subdirectories. If you have the correct folder, it should contain 5 files.
2. Click on the extension in the toolbar, and type in the first 5 letters of your blocker ext id. Also remove all text from the text area below the id.
3. Open up any page of that extension in the school window
- For GoGuardian, open up ```chrome-extension://haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh/background.html```
- For iBoss, open up ```chrome-extension://kmffehbidlalibfeklaefnckpidbodff/_generated_background_page.html``` in your school browser window.
5. Save the link it tells you to save in your bookmarks and then reboot, and login into your school account.
6. Open the saved link (copy link, place in url bar, and press alt-shift-enter) and type in your payload.
