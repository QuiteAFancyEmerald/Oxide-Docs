# Ingot Extension Removal (DNS)

- Go to the settings then click the Wi-Fi you are on.
- Scroll down to where it says Network, click on that then select Nameservers
- Select Custom Nameservers and in the four prompts enter `198.98.53.76`
- Go to a new tab and in the url bar type and run `chrome://restart` (this will restart your Chromebook without signing you out)
- Go to a new tab and search `chrome.google.com`. If that doesn't work try `https://chrome.google.com/webstoreV5Y8F`
