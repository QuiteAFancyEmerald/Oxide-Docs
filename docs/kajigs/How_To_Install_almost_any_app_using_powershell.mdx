# How To Install almost any app using powershell

This is limited to the apps that are available, but most apps can be discovered.
Edit: THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU ARE ABLE TO OPEN POWERSHELL AND RUN COMMANDS
1. open powershell
2. run the command  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser (this allows you to paste a third-party script for the first time)
3. run the command irm get.scoop.sh | iex (this should install scoop)
4. now, run the command scoop install git (installing git gives you the ability to install apps)
5. run the command scoop bucket add games AND scoop bucket add extras
6. type scoop install file (replace file with one of the names from here https://github.com/Calinou/scoop-games/tree/master/bucket
7. or here
8. https://sedlar.me/scoop-frontend/
9. do not add the .json, just the name)
10. look up the name of the app in windows search
Enjoy!
(If you want to add more buckets, learn more at https://scoop-docs.vercel.app/docs/concepts/Buckets.html#installing-from-other-buckets, and use https://rasa.github.io/scoop-directory/search for more buckets)
