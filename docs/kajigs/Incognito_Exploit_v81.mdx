# Incognito Exploit (v81)

This is the first Licensed exploit to be declassified as a Kajig!

This still needs to be improved.

Make sure to downgrade to chrome OS v81 or lower first: "Chrome100 - Downgrade your Chrome OS"

## Steps to the Incognito Exploit, summarized

(Steps before include getting on the login screen to the part where you are signing in as a new user. Enter your email and password but don't login. Do Alt + Shift + I. Continue to Step 1 where you spam "Privacy Policy".)

- Follow the steps but once it gets to the "Privacy Policy" part, spam it for a minute or 30 seconds (until its very laggy)
- Once you login go quickly to the Incognito Tab and do Ctrl+Shift+N
- Do the Switch/Desktop View key and close the original Incognito Tab
- If it continues to open policy pages, repeat Step 3.

## Benefits:

- No extensions so you won't have to worry about anything being blocked by an extension.
- Access to a fully unrestricted YouTube.
- Ability to sign into other google accounts. (if blocked)
- Be able to access the majority of chrome:// urls if they were blocked by policy.
- Get past policy blocks. (Untested fully but certain sites that were blocked by policy were unblocked for me.)
- Use flags to further experiment with you chromebook. Applies to chrome:// urls being unblocked.
- Access to an "experimental" unblocked chrome. (Called experimental as it is both restricted and not restricted.)

## Possible Errors (you may encounter):

- When importing an onc file, crash.
- Don't go to chrome://os-settings or try to view Settings from the Incognito tab.
- Restarting to modify flags will close the tab, however the effects will be applied when you restart.
- When importing an extension (unpacked or entire crx), you will encounter the error "not allowed on login screen"

The following exploit is still a massive WIP and the following above may be subject to change or expand.
