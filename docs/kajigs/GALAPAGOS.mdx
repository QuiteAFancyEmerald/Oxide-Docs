# GALAPAGOS
Galapagos is not an exploit, but rather a tool designed to help you find oversights in applocker
the tool will scan applocker rules on your PC to find locations where they are not enforced, and where you may be able to run executables

## Requirements:
- Windows 7+
- Microsoft Excel
- A capable mind 
- You can't be a skid, this isn't an exploit and alone it is nearly useless

## Steps:
1. Download linked file
2. Go to properties and then select unblock and apply
3. Open the file
4. Enable editing
5. Enable content
6. Click run GALAPAGOS
7. Begin the system analysis


once the analysis is done, you will be left with paths where EXEs are allowed to run. put your EXE into one of these paths (and rename them if required) and then execute them
