# KIOSK Exploit (DE-LICENSED) (Original):

Although many variations of this exploit exist, this was the very original implementation of it. However, the process never went as far or flexible as a full Chrome browser window being able to be created out of this method rather than just a simple bypass within the KIOSK app.

Credits to B3AT and Divide for this exploit.

This exploit allows you to open an unrestricted Chrome instance within a kiosk app, i.e. with the kiosk user account permissions.

## Steps:

- Any kiosk app installed
- [for v77<=x<=v85] OOBE/fresh install
- Sign out
- Turn Wi-Fi off
- Enable ChromeVox (ctrl+alt+z)
- Open a kiosk app
- Spam Search+o+k (you do have to re-click o and k)
- While spamming click "Diagnose"

Note: The exploit should work consistently v76 or below but it's still possible to pull off on v85 or below, but only once (right after you powerwash).
