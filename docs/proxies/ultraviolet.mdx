# Ultraviolet

Highly sophisticated proxy used for evading internet censorship or accessing websites in a controlled sandbox using the power of service-workers and more!

[**GitHub**](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet)

## Setup

Ultraviolet works by intercepting HTTP requests with a service worker script that follows the TompHTTP specifications. More information regarding TompHTTP can be found [here](../../tomphttp).

The components of Ultraviolet are as follows:

- BareServer V1 TompHTTP
- Ultraviolet-Static
- Ultraviolet-Node (Production AIO)

See the changelog if you're using v1.0.1 or above!

## Building

1. Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet.git
> Cloning into Ultraviolet...
$ cd Ultraviolet
```

2. Install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

3. Produce the `dist/` directory and compile scripts

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### I don't care about building, where are the scripts for my website?!

You can extract the scripts from the NPM package in the [releases section](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet/releases). All the scripts you would typically look for (`uv.bundle.js`, `uv.handler.js`, `uv.sw.js`, and `uv.config.js`) are found within the `dist` directory.

If you cannot open the tar.gz (Chrome OS?), use a [converter](https://cloudconvert.com/tar.gz-to-zip). We can only do so much to make the scripts accessible.

## Installation

> This will provide built files and the JS API to access the path of dist files.

Currently, we don't have an NPM package. As a current solution, you can install from a [GitHub release](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet/releases). Copy the link to the `.tgz` and install using NPM.

````sh
$ npm install https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet/releases/download/v1.0.1/ultraviolet-1.0.1.tgz

## Packaging

This is intended for releasing on hosting the package as a file, not on NPM.

```sh
$ npm pack
````

Package will be named `ultraviolet-X.X.X.tgz`

## Changelogs

### v1.0.4

Massive rework for Ultraviolet! Improvements to resource usage, performance and overall site support.
TODO!

### v1.0.2

This package now targets CommonJS.

### v1.0.1

In your `sw.js` script, you MUST import `uv.bundle.js` then `uv.config.js` in order. This is because we can no longer hard-code the paths. Ideally, we would import `uv.config.js` then use the config.bundle path in the serviceworker, however the config is dependant on `uv.bundle.js`, which we don't know the location to.

Old:

```js
importScripts("./uv/uv.sw.js");

const sw = new UVServiceWorker();

self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => event.respondWith(sw.fetch(event)));
```

New:

```diff
+ importScripts('./uv/uv.bundle.js');
+ importScripts('./uv/uv.config.js');
importScripts('./uv/uv.sw.js');

const sw = new UVServiceWorker();

self.addEventListener('fetch', event =>
    event.respondWith(
        sw.fetch(event)
    )
);
```

You are still required to specify all paths in `uv.config.js`.
